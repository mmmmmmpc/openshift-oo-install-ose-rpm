OpenShift Enterprise Installer RPM
==================================

This is an attempt to package the Official OpenShift Enterprise installer into an RPM

Original installer files are deployed into /opt/oo-install-ose
A wrapper is deployed into /usr/sbin to make possible to launch the offline installer without moving into the installer folder

This is not officially related to OpenShift Enterprise, so, you are on your own with this files :-)

Enjoy!
